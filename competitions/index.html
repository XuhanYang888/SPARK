          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              The SPARK Research Challenge is built on a simple but powerful
              belief: curiosity is the foundation of all meaningful learning.
              Research is not reserved for laboratories, professionals, or
              advanced degrees, it begins when a student notices the world
              around them and asks thoughtful questions about how and why things
              happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              This challenge was designed by the SPARK HQ departments to give
              students a structured, professional, and intellectually engaging
              introduction to research. The goal is not to measure how much
              students already know, but to evaluate how well they can think,
              question, analyze, and propose ideas grounded in evidence and
              logic. SPARK values originality, clarity, and real-world relevance
              over memorization or technical complexity.
            </p>

          <h2>Eligibility</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              The SPARK Research Challenge is open to students from any country
              who are in Grade 12 or below.
            </p>
            <div class="division-info">

            </div>
            <p>
              Students who are eligible for the Junior Division may choose to
              compete in the Senior Division if they wish.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2>Competition Rules & Academic Integrity</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              All participants are expected to uphold high standards of honesty,
              responsibility, and academic integrity throughout the S.P.A.R.K.
              Research Challenge. These rules exist to ensure fairness,
              learning, and meaningful participation for all students. Failure
              to comply may result in disqualification or removal from the
              competition.
            </p>
            <div class="rules-section">
              <h4>Proper Citation of Sources</h4>
              <p>
                All non-original ideas used in the proposal must be clearly
                cited. This includes information obtained from books, articles,
                websites, videos, databases, or AI-assisted tools. Proper
                citation demonstrates respect for intellectual property and
                allows reviewers to verify the accuracy of information.
              </p>
              <h4>Authenticity of Experience and Work</h4>
              <p>
                Any personal experiences, observations, experiments, or claims
                described in the proposal must be truthful and authentic.
                Submissions should reflect the participant's own understanding
                and effort. Fabrication, exaggeration, or misrepresentation of
                experiences is strictly prohibited.
              </p>
              <h4>Deadline Compliance</h4>
              <p>
                All submissions must be completed and submitted by the official
                deadline. Deadlines are final, and no extensions will be granted
                under any circumstances. This policy ensures fairness and equal
                opportunity for all participants.
              </p>
              <h4>Originality</h4>
              <p>
                Submissions must be original work created specifically for the
                S.P.A.R.K. Research Challenge. Plagiarism, including copying
                from other students, online sources, or previously submitted
                work, is not permitted.

          <h2>AI Usage Policy</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              SPARK recognizes that artificial intelligence is an important and
              rapidly evolving tool in modern education and research. As such,
              the use of AI tools is allowed and encouraged when used
              responsibly and ethically.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Participants may use AI to assist with brainstorming ideas,
                improving clarity, organizing thoughts, or understanding complex
                concepts.
              </li>
              <li>
                AI should be treated as a support tool, not a replacement for
                the participant's own thinking, reasoning, and understanding.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any factual claims, statistics, or citations suggested by AI
                must be verified through credible and reliable references.
                Invalid, fabricated, or unverifiable sources provided by AI
                tools must not be used.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students are expected to fully understand and be able to explain
                the content of their proposal. Submissions that demonstrate
                overreliance on AI without genuine comprehension may be
                penalized.
              </li>
              <li>
                The core ideas, research question, and reasoning must reflect
                the student's own intellectual contribution.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              SPARK's goal is not to restrict technology, but to ensure that it
              is used in a way that enhances learning, critical thinking, and
              academic honesty.

              <h4>Senior & Junior SPARK Research Excellence Award</h4>
              <p>
                This award is given to the strongest overall research proposal
                in the Senior/Junior Division. Judges will look for clear
                reasoning, effective use of online research explained in the
                student's own words, and a well-designed experimental plan
                appropriate for the respective age division.
              </p>
              <h4>Outstanding Research Design</h4>
              <p>
                This award is given to a proposal with an especially strong and
                well-thought-out experimental plan. Judges will look for clear
                control of variables, fairness, and realistic methods that show
                careful planning.
              </p>
              <h4>Honourable Mention</h4>
              <p>
                This recognition is given to proposals that demonstrate strong
                effort, curiosity, or potential. Judges may award this to
                projects that are well-structured and thoughtful, even if not
                all sections are fully developed.
              </p>
              <h4>Innovation & Creativity Award</h4>
              <p>
                This award recognizes proposals with original ideas or creative
                approaches. Judges will look for unique or niche research
                questions and meaningful connections that go beyond common or
                expected topics.
              </p>
              <h4>Impact & Application Award</h4>
              <p>
                This award is given to proposals that clearly connect their
                research idea to real-world use. Judges will look for realistic
                and meaningful applications that logically follow from the
                project's goals.
