                All participants are expected to uphold high standards of
                honesty, responsibility, and academic integrity throughout the
                S.P.A.R.K. Research Challenge. These rules exist to ensure
                fairness, learning, and meaningful participation for all
                students. Failure to comply may result in disqualification or
                removal from the competition.

                <h4>Proper Citation of Sources</h4>
                <p>
                  All non-original ideas used in the proposal must be clearly
                  cited. This includes information obtained from books,
                  articles, websites, videos, databases, or AI-assisted tools.
                  Proper citation demonstrates respect for intellectual property
                  and allows reviewers to verify the accuracy of information.
                </p>
                <h4>Authenticity of Experience and Work</h4>
                <p>
                  Any personal experiences, observations, experiments, or claims
                  described in the proposal must be truthful and authentic.
                  Submissions should reflect the participant's own understanding
                  and effort. Fabrication, exaggeration, or misrepresentation of
                  experiences is strictly prohibited.
                </p>
                <h4>Deadline Compliance</h4>
                <p>
                  All submissions must be completed and submitted by the
                  official deadline. Deadlines are final, and no extensions will
                  be granted under any circumstances. This policy ensures
                  fairness and equal opportunity for all participants.
                </p>
                <h4>Originality</h4>
                <p>
                  Submissions must be original work created specifically for the
                  S.P.A.R.K. Research Challenge. Plagiarism, including copying
                  from other students, online sources, or previously submitted
                  work, is not permitted.

            <div>
              <p>
                SPARK recognizes that artificial intelligence is an important
                and rapidly evolving tool in modern education and research. As
                such, the use of AI tools is allowed and encouraged when used
                responsibly and ethically.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Participants may use AI to assist with brainstorming ideas,
                  improving clarity, organizing thoughts, or understanding
                  complex concepts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  AI should be treated as a support tool, not a replacement for
                  the participant's own thinking, reasoning, and understanding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any factual claims, statistics, or citations suggested by AI
                  must be verified through credible and reliable references.
                  Invalid, fabricated, or unverifiable sources provided by AI
                  tools must not be used.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Students are expected to fully understand and be able to
                  explain the content of their proposal. Submissions that
                  demonstrate overreliance on AI without genuine comprehension
                  may be penalized.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The core ideas, research question, and reasoning must reflect
                  the student's own intellectual contribution.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                SPARK's goal is not to restrict technology, but to ensure that
                it is used in a way that enhances learning, critical thinking,
                and academic honesty.

                <h4>Senior & Junior SPARK Research Excellence Award</h4>
                <p>
                  This award is given to the strongest overall research proposal
                  in the Senior/Junior Division. Judges will look for clear
                  reasoning, effective use of online research explained in the
                  student's own words, and a well-designed experimental plan
                  appropriate for the respective age division.
                </p>
                <h4>Outstanding Research Design</h4>
                <p>
                  This award is given to a proposal with an especially strong
                  and well-thought-out experimental plan. Judges will look for
                  clear control of variables, fairness, and realistic methods
                  that show careful planning.
                </p>
                <h4>Honourable Mention</h4>
                <p>
                  This recognition is given to proposals that demonstrate strong
                  effort, curiosity, or potential. Judges may award this to
                  projects that are well-structured and thoughtful, even if not
                  all sections are fully developed.
                </p>
                <h4>Innovation & Creativity Award</h4>
                <p>
                  This award recognizes proposals with original ideas or
                  creative approaches. Judges will look for unique or niche
                  research questions and meaningful connections that go beyond
                  common or expected topics.
                </p>
                <h4>Impact & Application Award</h4>
                <p>
                  This award is given to proposals that clearly connect their
                  research idea to real-world use. Judges will look for
                  realistic and meaningful applications that logically follow
                  from the project's goals.
