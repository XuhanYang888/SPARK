            SPARK (Science Projects and Research for Kids) is a student-led
            non-profit organization dedicated to empowering elementary and
            middle school students to become young scientists through hands-on
            experiments, creative projects, and guided research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Formerly known as KAST Ontario, SPARK was born from the belief that
            kids don't need to wait to grow up to make discoveries, they just
            need the tools, support, and encouragement to get started. Founded
            by passionate high school students, we are on a mission to
            revolutionize youth science education and spark curiosity in every
            child.

          <p>
            Our mission is to revolutionize how kids experience science, from
            passive learning in textbooks to active discovery through doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are building a growing network of high school volunteers across
            North America who believe that science should be hands-on,
            accessible, and fun. Provide partner schools with resources, help
            them establish their own SPARK branch. With mentorship and
            meaningful interaction at the heart of everything we do, we aim to
            show that real science starts with curiosity, not age. At SPARK, we
            believe: Kids can be scientists too.
