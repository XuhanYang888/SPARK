            <summary>What does SPARK actually do?</summary>
            <div>
              SPARK empowers high school and college students to lead engaging,
              hands-on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math)
              workshops for elementary and middle school students, especially in
              communities where access to hands-on STEM activities is limited.
              Branch leaders recruit passionate volunteers to bring these
              experiences to life.

            <summary>What does the Headquarters do?</summary>
            <div>
              The SPARK Headquarters is a team of dedicated students who support
              branches across the globe. They create lesson plans, record
              educational videos, manage the website, and provide financial and
              logistical support to local branches when needed.

            <summary>How much does it cost to start a branch?</summary>
            <div>
              Nothing at all! All SPARK resources—curriculum, training,
              support—are completely free. There’s no cost to get started. We do
              offer optional merchandise, but it’s not required. For us at HQ,
              the greatest reward is seeing branches make a lasting impact.

            <summary>What is the origin of this organization?</summary>
            <div>
              SPARK began as “Kids Are Scientists Too” (KAST) over 15 years ago.
              It started with a few passionate individuals and quickly grew to
              over 20 regions, led by high school and undergraduate students
              bringing STEAM to young learners. When KAST HQ ceased operations
              in 2021, many branches chose to continue independently, uniting
              under a new name—SPARK—to keep the mission alive and growing.

            <summary>How can I help?</summary>
            <div>
              The best way to help? Start a SPARK branch in your
              community—especially if your school doesn't already have one. Not
              ready to lead a branch? You can still support us by spreading the
              word, sharing our mission, or connecting us with friends who might
              want to get involved. We also welcome donations and sponsorships.
              SPARK is a nonprofit, and your financial support helps us reach
              more students around the world.
